# OpenCV: Count Circles Hough

This project implements the Hough Circle Transform (HCT) algorithm using OpenMP + OpenMPI to perform distributed image processing. By splitting the computational workload across multiple processes and threads, it significantly reduces the time required to detect the number of circles in high-resolution 2D images (view from above). An edge detection algorithm is first applied on the source image. Binning and spacing algorithms are then used to eliminate overlapping circles.

## Requirements

* GCC 9.3.0
* OpenMP 5.0
* OpenMPI 4.0.4
* OpenCV 4.1.0

## Installation

Compile the program using the *make* build system:
```
make
make clean
```

## Execution

Execute the progam using the command line:

```
[mpiexec -n <number of mpi processes>] ./CountCirclesHough [<parameters>]
```

Example:

```
./CountCirclesHough images/money2.png -imp=1 -omp-threads=4 -mpi=0 -gui=1 -eval-times=10 -blur=0 -blur-ksize=5 -edges=1 -edges-ksize=3 -sobel-bw-tresh=128 -canny-tresh1=275 -canny-tresh2=125 -min-radius=25 -max-radius=35 -peak-tresh=135 -use-binning=1 -bin-size=40 -use-spacing=1 -spacing-size=40
```
